# Guess The Number Game
This is a simple number guessing game that prompts the player to guess a number between 1 and 100. It includes two different difficulty levels, "easy" and "hard", where "easy" provides the player with 10 guesses and "hard" provides only 5 guesses.

# Objectives
* Include an ASCII art logo.  
* Allow the player to submit a guess for a number between 1 and 100.  
* Check user's guess against actual answer. Print "Too high." or "Too low." depending on the user's answer.  
* If they got the answer correct, show the actual answer to the player.  
* Track the number of turns remaining.  
* If they run out of turns, provide feedback to the player.
